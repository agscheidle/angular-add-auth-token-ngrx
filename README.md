# AngularAddAuthTokenNgrx

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.3.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to add authentication tokens to all of HTTP requests when the token is stored in an NGRX store.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4300/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Development server

You can also run the client and back-end servers individually.

* Run `npm run client` for a client dev server. 
    * `http://localhost:4300/`
* Run `npm run server` for a backend in-memory JSON database.
    * `http://localhost:4301/`
* Run `npm run dev` to start both the client and server concurrently.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
